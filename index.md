## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in [Microelectronic Science and Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

Since 2025, I have been a research intern at the [Computer Systems Laboratory](https://zhang.ece.cornell.edu/) of [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), advised by [Prof. Zhiru Zhang](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz/). My research interests lie in building efficient computer systems and exploring cross-layer co-design for AI and heterogeneous computing.

Previously, I conducted undergraduate research at the [THU HAS Lab](https://www.thu-haslab.org/), advised by [Prof. Shuwen Deng](https://www.thu-haslab.org/author/shuwen-deng/). I have also been mentored by [Prof. Maokun Li](https://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/limaokun1/en/index.htm), who has provided long-term guidance during my undergraduate studies.

**I will graduate in 2026 and am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities for Fall 2026!**

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in computer architecture, system design, and the intersection of AI and efficient computing. 

My academic focus includes topics such as GPU systems, compiler-guided hardware/software co-design, and reconfigurable architectures for emerging applications. I am particularly drawn to building general-purpose yet high-performance systems that serve AI, bioinformatics, and other data-intensive domains.
