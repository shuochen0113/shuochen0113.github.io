## About Me

I am an undergraduate student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in [Microelectronic Science and Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

Currently, I have been a research intern at the [Computer Systems Laboratory](https://zhang.ece.cornell.edu/) of [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), advised by [Prof. Zhiru Zhang](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz/). Concurrently, I also work with [Prof. Bowen Zhou](https://c3i.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/author/bowen-zhou/) and [Dr. Youbang Sun](https://c3i.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/author/youbang-sun/) at the [Center for Collaborative & Conversational Intelligence, Tsinghua University](https://c3i.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). My broad research interests lie in building efficient computer systems and exploring cross-layer co-design for AI and heterogeneous computing.

Previously, I was an undergraduate researcher at the [THU HAS Lab](https://www.thu-haslab.org/), advised by [Prof. Shuwen Deng](https://www.thu-haslab.org/author/shuwen-deng/). I have also been mentored by [Prof. Maokun Li](https://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/limaokun1/en/index.htm), who has provided long-term guidance during my undergraduate studies.

**I will graduate in 2026 and am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities for Fall 2026!**

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in Computer Architecture, MLSys, and AI Infrastructure.

My academic focus centers on hardware-software co-design for heterogeneous computing, with a particular emphasis on GPU system optimization. I am drawn to build general-purpose, high-performance systems that democratize efficiency for AI models and scientific discovery (e.g., bioinformatics).
