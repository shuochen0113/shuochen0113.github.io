## About Me

Iâ€™m a senior undergraduate student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in [Microelectronic Science and Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

During my undergraduate study, Iâ€™ve been fortunate to receive guidance from [Prof. Zhiru Zhang](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz/) at Cornell University and [Prof. Shuwen Deng](https://www.thu-haslab.org/author/shuwen-deng/) at Tsinghua University, whose mentorship inspired my research interest in computer architecture and hardware/software systems. I also deeply appreciate the longstanding support from [Prof. Maokun Li](https://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/limaokun1/en/index.htm), who has served as my faculty advisor throughout my undergraduate years.

**I will graduate in 2026 and am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities for Fall 2026.**

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in computer architecture, system design, and the intersection of AI and efficient computing. My academic focus includes topics such as GPU systems, compiler-guided hardware/software co-design, and reconfigurable architectures for emerging applications. I am particularly drawn to building general-purpose yet high-performance systems that serve AI, bioinformatics, and other data-intensive domains.
